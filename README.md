# infer-entity-headers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/infer-entity-headers.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/infer-entity-headers) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/meryn/infer-entity-headers.png)](https://david-dm.org/meryn/infer-entity-headers)

Infers http entity headers from path, entity and existing headers.

## Functionality

If any of the following headers are not given:

* `content-type` header is set to the type returned by [`mime.lookup`](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime#mimelookuppath) with `charset` set  according to [`mime.charsets.lookup`](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime#mimecharsetslookup) (if any).
* `content-length` is set to the length of the entity buffer.
* `last-modified` is set to the current time.
* `etag` is set the MD5 hash of the entity buffer.

Any given headers are left alone. Header names will be transformed to lowercase.

## Usage

The exported function takes three arguments: `url`, `entity` and `headers`. 

* `url` can be an absolute url or just a relative path. Only the path is used.
* `entity` is optional. If it's provided, it must be either a Buffer or a String.
* `headers` is optional too. It signifies the current headers for the entity. Headers which are already set will be left alone.

```javascript
var inferHeaders = require("infer-entity-headers")
var headers = inferHeaders("/somefile.txt", "some contents", {})
```

The returned `headers` object contains all existing headers plus any inferred headers.
